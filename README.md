# TechCamp RC Cars

## Introduction

This is the code I have written for the TechCamp RC Cars course.

NB. This code is only for the transmitter.

## Differences

The modifications I have made are with the aim to simplify the code and add demo features the students can implement.
New Features:
- Refactored code to only expose the necessary functions to the students.
- Made it easier to change the throttle/steering input / driving style.
- Added an example 'dashboard' for a race screen with speedometers and gear counters.
- Added example start up screens: Plain text, mandelbrot set, perlin noise.

## How to use modifications
Various modifications to the code can be found in the ```/Modifications```  folder. These are seperated into Driving, 
Race screen and Startup screen modifications. In each file it will say what you can copy and paste into the main code.
